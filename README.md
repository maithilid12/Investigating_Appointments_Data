# Introduction
In this project, a dataset consisting information from 100k medical appointments in public hospitals at Vitoria, Brazil is investigated. The reason why the patient did not show up to their appointment attracts my attention. This dataset contains records whether patients miss appointments, attributes of paients and information about apointments.After inital assessment of data, I have formulated set of questions to help identify factors that are vital to be known in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment:
1. Does sending a SMS reminder increase the attendance of the patient? Is it affected by Gender?
2. Is there a correlation between type of disease and attendance of patient for the appointment?
3. Which age group has secured most scholarships and does it affect the attendance at appointment?

# Results
1. Does sending a SMS reminder increase the attendance of the patient? Is it affected by Gender?
     - Receiving SMS reminders does not increase patient attendance and thus a suggestion can be made to discontinue this service to save cost of operation
2. Is there a correlation between type of disease and attendance of patient for the appointment?
     - The type of disease does not increase patient attendance and more number of patients experience Hypertension
3. Which age group has secured most scholarships and does it affect the attendance at appointment?
     - Having a scholarship increases the chances of a patient attending the appointment which is people with the age 35 and above
